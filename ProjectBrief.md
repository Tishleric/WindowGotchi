# WindowGotchi: Tamagotchi-Inspired Desktop Pet Design

## 1. Canonical Tamagotchi Specification

**Life Stages & Evolution:** The original 1996 Tamagotchi (P1) progresses through distinct life stages with fixed timings. After setting the clock, an **Egg** appears and hatches in about 5 minutes. The **Baby** stage lasts \~65 minutes before evolving to a **Child**. The pet becomes a **Teenager** at an age of 3 days and an **Adult** by age 6 days. (Tamagotchi “age” increments once per real day.) Each classic Tamagotchi character has one baby, one child, two teens, six adults, and one secret **special character** that can evolve from certain adults under ideal care. Evolution outcomes depend on care quality: better care leads to healthier adult characters. Adults have a finite lifespan and will eventually die of old age, with maximum lifespans varying by character. Neglect can cause premature death, but even with perfect care the pet will pass on when it reaches its character’s lifespan limit.

**Hunger & Happiness Meters:** The pet’s needs are represented by four **Hungry hearts** and four **Happy hearts** (each heart is either filled or empty). Hearts gradually empty over time. As the pet grows older (especially in the adult stage), the rate of heart depletion accelerates. In the original P1, an adult at maximum age can lose about 1 Hungry heart every 6 minutes and 1 Happy heart every 7 minutes at worst (younger stages and healthier characters have slower depletion). When either meter drops to zero, the Tamagotchi “calls” for care via an attention icon and audible beep. The player must refill the hearts to meet the pet’s needs. **Feeding a Meal** fills one Hungry heart (if any are empty). **Playing a game** (a simple “guess the direction” game on P1) increases Happy hearts – winning the game (e.g. guessing correctly 3 out of 5 rounds) raises the Happy meter by one heart. If the pet is full (all Hungry hearts full), it will refuse a Meal. However, the pet never refuses **Snacks**, which act as treats that instantly fill one Happy heart. Over-reliance on snacks is bad care: each Snack adds 2 units of weight (Meals add 1 unit), and feeding too many snacks in a short time can make the Tamagotchi ill and even kill it – in fact, overfeeding snacks is the only way a baby Tamagotchi can die before evolving. Thus, the intended care loop is to play games to boost happiness instead of excessive snacking.

**Discipline & Training:** The original Tamagotchi introduced a **Discipline meter** (often called training). When a Tamagotchi occasionally **calls for attention despite not truly needing anything** (for example, it refuses to eat or play even though it isn’t completely hungry or unhappy), this is a misbehavior that the player must correct by using the Discipline command. A successful discipline fills 25% of the training meter. The pet typically makes only a limited number of discipline calls per stage – just enough to potentially fill the meter by the end of the stage. (E.g. in P1, the child stage characters make 4 discipline calls if starting from 0%, each adding 25%, so the meter can reach 100% by the time it becomes teen.) Discipline level may partially reset upon evolution (teens often start with some discipline level halved). Responding to every discipline call is considered **good care**, while ignoring them is bad – discipline affects evolution; higher discipline tends to yield more evolved, healthy characters. If the discipline meter is filled early, the pet will simply stop calling for discipline in that stage. (Disciplining when the pet is not misbehaving has no effect.) Missing a needed discipline (on modern re-releases) is counted as a distinct “discipline mistake”, though on the original P1 it just meant a lower training level.

**Other Care Actions:** The original device provides additional functions via icons:

* **Cleaning (Bathroom):** The pet periodically produces **poop** on the screen, which must be cleaned using the toilet icon. If poop is left on screen too long, it greatly increases the chance of the Tamagotchi falling ill. Multiple poop pileups drastically raise illness likelihood. The frequency of bowel movements depends on stage: a baby will poop twice (at \~15 minutes and \~40-45 minutes after hatching) during its \~1 hour baby phase. A child will poop about 5 minutes after evolving into the stage, then roughly every 3 hours. (Teens/adults continue at longer intervals, e.g. every few hours, varying by character.) Prompt cleanup is ideal; otherwise, sickness may occur.
* **Illness & Medicine:** When the Tamagotchi gets sick, a **skull icon** appears. The pet won’t eat or play until cured. Sickness can happen from accumulated bad care: it may occur **if poop is left too long, if the pet is overfed snacks,** right before an evolution, or as a natural part of old age. The player must select the **Medicine** icon to administer medicine; it may take one or two doses to fully cure an illness. Sickness in old age is a sign the pet is nearing end-of-life – each time an elderly Tamagotchi falls ill due to age, its hearts start dropping faster thereafter. Notably, curing illness does not itself count as a care mistake (delaying medicine won’t flag a mistake), but if a sickness is left untreated for too long the pet can die from it.
* **Lights On/Off:** At bedtime, the Tamagotchi will show it is sleepy (or an attention call) and needs the lights turned off. The original device includes a light toggle icon; the player is expected to turn off the lights when the pet falls asleep (and turn them back on in the morning). Failing to turn off lights counts as a care mistake on the original device (after 15 minutes of the attention call). This is part of maintaining good care (it ensures the pet sleeps well). The Tamagotchi baby stage typically doesn’t have a full overnight sleep – babies take a short nap and then wake up, whereas children and older have set bedtimes (e.g. a child might sleep through the night, often around 8 PM to 9 AM). Turning lights off is the last needed care each day.
* **Status Check:** There is a status screen (health meter) showing the pet’s **Age, Weight, Discipline level, Hunger, and Happiness**. Age is in days (years), weight was displayed in ounces/pounds (or grams in Japanese units). Using this screen does not affect gameplay except to inform the player. Original P1 had no pause button, but a clever workaround was that entering clock-set mode froze the game’s progress until resumed, effectively acting as a pause without penalty (time stands still while the clock is being adjusted).

**Care Mistakes & Death:** A **care mistake** is registered if the player fails to respond to an attention call within a certain window (roughly 15 minutes on originals). Specifically, if the pet’s Hungry or Happy hearts empty and the attention icon lights, or if it needs lights off at night, the player has \~15 minutes to take action before the pet stops calling – at that point, one care mistake is tallied. (Discipline calls are an exception – ignoring a discipline attention does **not** count as a care mistake in P1, it just means missing a training opportunity.) Accumulating multiple care mistakes influences evolution (e.g. more mistakes lead to poorer-quality adult characters) and will shorten the pet’s lifespan. Eventually, neglect or old age will trigger **Death**. If the pet dies, the screen shows a unique animation (e.g. an angel or ghost depending on version). Dying of **old age** after a long, well-cared life is considered the “natural” end: in fact, if an adult was cared for exceptionally well until death, the device shows a special animation of the pet leaving or laying an egg before departing, as a reward (this egg is symbolic and does not hatch). Poor care, by contrast, can result in premature death without any special send-off. After death, the user could reset the device to start over with a new egg. In summary, the original Tamagotchi’s full feature set included feeding and weight management, happiness via play, discipline training, cleaning waste, curing illness, sleep cycle management, and a growth evolution system tied to care – all orchestrated in real time with audible alerts, and with specific timing parameters (heart depletion rates, evolution times, etc.) grounded in the device’s internal clock.

## 2. Adaptation Analysis for WindowGotchi

**Modernizing Classic Mechanics:** WindowGotchi will preserve the core Tamagotchi gameplay while adapting it to a desktop computer environment. The table below summarizes which classic mechanics are kept, tweaked, or dropped in the transition:

* **Life Stages & Evolution:** *Preserved (with adjustments).* The concept of growing from egg→baby→child→teen→adult remains central, maintaining the excitement of evolution. However, timing will be adjusted for PC usage. On a desktop, users may not run the app continuously 24/7, so evolution might be based on **active play time or real calendar days** with flexibility. We will likely slow the progression slightly or allow pausing when the computer is off, so that reaching “age 6” (adulthood) might take, for example, a week of real time rather than 6 continuous days. This ensures casual users still experience the full life cycle. We preserve the idea that care quality (number of care mistakes, discipline level, etc.) influences which adult form you get, retaining depth for enthusiasts. We will also keep the concept of an eventual **natural death** (the pet has a finite lifespan) to mirror the original’s lifecycle. However, WindowGotchi could offer an **optional toggle** for “immortal mode” or respawning – some users might grow very attached and prefer the pet not die permanently. By default, though, death and restarting with a new egg is included, as it adds consequence to the care loop.

* **Hunger & Feeding:** *Preserved.* The Hungry meter and feeding mechanic will work much the same. The pet will lose hunger hearts over time and require feeding of meals. We’ll implement a menu or UI button to “Feed Meal” which increases hunger by one heart (if not full), analogous to the original. The **timing of hunger depletion** will be tuned for PC. The original could lose a heart as fast as every 6–10 minutes under certain conditions – that intensity would make a desktop pet very demanding or annoying if the user is focused on work. We might moderate this so that hearts empty more slowly (perhaps one hunger heart every \~30 minutes to an hour under normal conditions), or even dynamically adjust based on whether the user is active. The principle is to require periodic attention, but not so often that it’s disruptive in a modern workday context. When the pet is hungry (any empty hunger hearts), it will notify the user (e.g. via a toast notification rather than incessant beeping). Overfeeding rules remain: the pet will refuse meals if not hungry, just like the original, preventing spam-feeding. Snacks (treats) will also be included as an option to boost happiness (see below), but we will carry over the warning that excessive treats cause illness or other penalties.

* **Happiness & Play:** *Preserved, with enhancements.* The Happy meter (mood) stays, and the classic method to raise happiness was playing a mini-game. WindowGotchi can implement a simple mini-game in the GUI (for example, a small guessing game or a click-based game) to simulate the original “guess left/right” game. This maintains the core loop: responding to the pet’s boredom with interactive play. The threshold of winning to increase happiness (win ≥3 of 5 rounds to earn a happiness heart) will be retained. We might modernize the games over time (e.g. include a few mini-games for variety), but the principle of engaging the user in a quick diversion to make the pet happy remains. For users who don’t want to play, the Snack option exists as an easier but discouraged route to fill happy hearts. Snacks instantly give a happy heart at the cost of weight/health. We will preserve the **consequences of overuse of snacks**: WindowGotchi will track if you feed too many treats in a short span and can trigger an “upset stomach” or illness just like the real Tamagotchi did. This teaches players to prefer playing with the pet (healthy, active) over just feeding candy.

* **Discipline & Personality:** *Preserved (with slight modification).* The training mechanic is a unique aspect that gives the pet personality (sometimes it calls you for no good reason, effectively “crying wolf”). We absolutely keep this – WindowGotchi will have moments when the pet appears to ask for attention (perhaps a speech bubble like “Hey!” or a notification) even though its meters aren’t empty. If the user tries to feed or play at that time, the pet will *refuse*, confirming it’s just acting out. The user must then click the **Discipline** button (or select a menu option like “Scold” or perhaps a fun Clippy-style response like “Knock it off!”). Doing so will increment a training meter (e.g. we can show this as stars or a bar representing discipline level). We maintain the +25% per successful discipline response as in the original. Missing a discipline opportunity will be treated similarly to a care mistake (bad care), though on the original missing discipline wasn’t counted in the care mistake tally, it did affect which character you get. In WindowGotchi, ignoring misbehavior will likewise influence the pet’s evolution toward a more trouble-making character. We might soften this mechanic slightly to be user-friendly: for example, ensure that discipline calls happen with a reasonable frequency and perhaps during the pet’s active hours (we wouldn’t want the pet to demand discipline in the middle of the night or when the user is away from keyboard with no chance to respond). The *personality flavor* of this mechanic will be enhanced by the Clippy-style approach – the pet might make cheeky remarks when misbehaving (“I don’t wanna eat that!” in a speech bubble) to clearly cue the user that a scolding is needed, adding humor to the interaction.

* **Health, Illness & Medicine:** *Preserved.* Taking care of the pet’s health remains important. WindowGotchi will simulate illness as the consequence of neglect or certain bad behaviors. If the user neglects to clean poop or overfeeds snacks, the pet can fall **ill** (we’ll show perhaps a sick face or an icon like the original skull). The user must click the Medicine icon to heal the pet. We will implement the possibility that it might take more than one dose, just like the original where sometimes two doses are needed. One modern consideration is notification: if the pet gets sick while the app window is not in focus, we’ll send a system notification (“Your pet is feeling sick!”) because timely response is important. The window itself might visually change (e.g. color flash) to catch attention if visible. We will also handle **illness timing** more leniently: the original could die within a few hours of illness if untreated. On desktop, if the user is away for an extended time (like overnight), we don’t want to punish them with a dead pet by morning. Therefore, WindowGotchi might pause deterioration during system sleep (see Persistence below) or have the pet automatically recover after a long period (with consequences to its happiness maybe, but not death). Essentially, the pet won’t die from illness while your PC is off or you’re offline, as that would feel unfair in this context. But if the app is running and you’re actively ignoring it, it could result in the pet leaving.

* **Sanitation (Poop Cleanup):** *Preserved.* The pet will still “poop” as a fun visual element – likely an pixel art icon or little poop sprite appears in the window or next to the pet. The user will have a “Clean” or “Flush” button to clear it. We maintain the rule that leaving waste around contributes to illness risk. Technically, we will implement a counter or flag: if poop is on screen beyond a certain time (e.g. several minutes), the chance of the pet becoming sick increases. This mirrors the original’s hidden illness logic. Most players will promptly click clean (especially since on a PC, clicking an icon is even simpler than navigating with device buttons). We might also add some whimsical behavior – for example, if the pet’s window is very large, maybe the pet sprite could walk around and avoid the poop or make a disgusted face until it’s cleaned, adding feedback.

* **Sleep & Lights:** *Modified.* The daily sleep cycle will be implemented, but we’ll adapt it to PC usage patterns. On the original, if your pet fell asleep at e.g. 9 PM, you had to turn off the lights or it was a care mistake. In WindowGotchi, we can have a designated “bedtime” for the pet (perhaps configurable or based on its life stage). When that time comes, the pet will say it’s sleepy. Instead of requiring the user to manually toggle lights (which would be an odd mechanic on PC), we might simply dim the pet’s window or have the pet “go to sleep” state. We can include a light switch button if we want to be true to form – maybe clicking it toggles between a bright background and dark bedroom for the pet. Not turning it off could be treated as a minor care mistake, but since a desktop pet might run in the background, we might auto-turn off after some time to be forgiving. We will preserve the idea that the pet shouldn’t be disturbed during sleep. If the user tries to interact (feed/play) while it’s asleep, WindowGotchi could either ignore input or the pet might wake up annoyed (leading to a discipline scenario). Also, when the computer itself goes to sleep (or the user logs off), we will likely treat that as the pet also sleeping or being paused (see **State Persistence** below), so the pet’s schedule aligns with the user’s usage times to some extent.

* **Attention Alerts:** *Preserved (modernized).* The original device used a beeping sound and a small attention icon to indicate the pet needed something. For a desktop, we will use the system’s notification systems. On Windows 10/11, this means a **Toast Notification** (a small pop-up in the Action Center) saying something like “WindowGotchi: I’m hungry!” or “WindowGotchi needs attention (maybe it’s lonely!).” The app could also flash its taskbar icon or change the window title to “(!!!)” to draw the eye. We will ensure these notifications respect user settings (for instance, use Windows notifications so they can be silenced by Focus Assist during Do Not Disturb times). The 15-minute rule for care mistakes can be translated as follows: the notification will remain active and the pet will remain in need for a certain interval. If that interval passes without the user responding (feeding, cleaning, etc.), we count a care mistake. In practical terms, we might allow a bit more leeway – maybe 15 real minutes or possibly longer if the app knows the user is away (we can detect idle time or screen lock and pause the timer during that). The key is the *concept* of timely response remains, but we adapt to not unfairly punish if the user is truly AFK. Missing an attention call will influence evolution and could eventually lead to the pet leaving if repeated often (just as in the original where multiple care mistakes result in shorter lifespan and worse character).

* **Pause and Offline Handling:** *Modified.* Unlike a handheld toy carried everywhere, a desktop pet faces times when the computer is off or the user is not actively checking it. We will introduce a **Pause** functionality. This could be explicit (a user can toggle a pause mode if they know they’ll be away) and/or implicit (when the OS is suspended, we automatically pause). The original allowed pausing via setting mode exploit; we will make it a proper feature. When paused, time stops for the pet – hunger/happy won’t decrease, and no evolution progress is made. This ensures the pet doesn’t starve while you’re on vacation or your PC is off overnight. Additionally, when the app is closed or the system shuts down, we will automatically save state and pause the pet. Upon next launch, we could either resume exactly where it left off (no time passed for the pet), or simulate a *partial* passage of time if appropriate (for example, if the user was gone a very long time and wants a bit of progression, we might advance it modestly but not enough to kill it). These details will be fine-tuned with user experience in mind, but the overarching adaptation is to protect the pet (and the user’s investment in it) from being ruined by normal PC usage breaks.

**Windows-Specific Enhancements:** In addition to mapping core mechanics, WindowGotchi will leverage the Windows desktop environment for new features and integrations:

* **Resizable, DPI-Aware Window:** Unlike the fixed 32×16 pixel LCD screen of the original, WindowGotchi’s window can be resized. We will use a **2D pixel art** aesthetic for nostalgia, but allow the user to scale it up. The graphics will be designed for crisp scaling (using nearest-neighbor interpolation so pixels stay sharp rather than blurry, preserving the retro look even at high DPI) – important for 4K monitors and various window sizes. The application will declare itself **DPI-aware** so Windows scaling doesn’t blur it; instead we handle scaling inside (e.g. by choosing appropriate pixel-art asset sizes or using CSS `image-rendering: pixelated` if web-based). This ensures the pet looks good on all displays.

* **System Tray Integration:** To make the pet unobtrusive when needed, WindowGotchi will have the option to **minimize to the system tray** (the notification area). When minimized this way, the app’s icon (perhaps an egg or the pet’s face) sits in the tray. The pet can continue running (hearts still decrease, etc.), and it can still send notifications or even animate the tray icon (for example, flash or bounce slightly when attention is needed). The user can click the tray icon to restore the pet’s window at any time. This behavior is common for lightweight background apps on Windows and will make WindowGotchi feel like a true desktop companion rather than a regular task. We will handle tray icon interactions using the OS API (e.g. in our chosen framework, use the provided tray utilities). We’ll also support a context menu on the tray icon (right-click) with quick actions like “Feed” or “Pause” or “Open Window”, so users can perform simple care actions without opening the full window – a convenience made possible by desktop integration.

* **Notifications & Sounds:** As mentioned, we’ll use Windows toast notifications for attention calls. We will also include sound cues: short, cute chimes or beeps to accompany important alerts (like a hunger call or discipline event), akin to the device’s beeps but more pleasant. These should respect the system sound settings (and we’ll provide a mute option in app settings for those who prefer silence). The pet could also vocalize some phrases via text bubble or even a synthesized voice (Clippy-style) at times – though voice might become annoying, so we’ll likely stick to text and simple sounds. The **Clippy-style personality** will shine through these notifications and animations: e.g., the pet might occasionally pop up and say things like “You’ve been working for an hour, feed me some attention!” in a playful way. The key is to make notifications helpful and cute, not distracting spam. We will also integrate with Windows 10/11’s **focus assist** modes so that, for example, if you’re presenting or gaming (fullscreen), the pet might defer non-critical notifications (or automatically go into a quiet “sleep” state during your focus period).

* **Power State Handling:** WindowGotchi will detect system suspend/resume events. On Windows, we can catch messages or events when the system is about to sleep (or hibernate) and when it wakes. Using this, the app will gracefully pause the pet as the machine sleeps, and possibly log the time. On resume, it can decide how to handle the elapsed time. As noted in Pause, by default we will act as if time was frozen (no hunger loss) during sleep. We’ll also save state to disk on suspend in case the battery dies or similar. If the user manually exits the app, we similarly ensure state persistence (so they can reboot or upgrade the app without losing their pet).

* **Automatic Updates:** We plan to include an **auto-update** mechanism that operates seamlessly on Windows. Many modern frameworks (like Electron and Tauri) have this built-in. We will configure it to check for updates (either via the Microsoft Store if we distribute there, or via an online release feed). The updater will download and apply new versions in the background, with minimal interruption. Crucially, we will preserve the pet’s state across updates – the state file will not be overwritten by updating the app. After an update, the new version will read the existing save and the pet’s life continues. We’ll also likely notify the user (“WindowGotchi updated!” possibly with a cute comment like the pet got new toys) to keep transparency. Cross-platform, we’ll plan similar update flows for Mac/Linux in the future.

* **Accessibility:** Making WindowGotchi accessible ensures a wider audience can enjoy it. We will design the UI controls (buttons, menus) to be usable via keyboard only (with appropriate focus highlights and accelerator keys) and ensure compatibility with Windows Narrator and screen readers by providing text labels and descriptions for every important element (e.g. the pet’s current status can be read out). For example, the application window title or an accessible UI element can always reflect the pet’s needs (“Happy 3/4, Hungry 1/4, Needs attention!”) so a visually impaired user could query that via a screen reader. We will also ensure color choices are high-contrast or offer a high-contrast mode, since pixel art can sometimes be hard to see for color-blind users – using distinct shapes/icons for different needs (hunger vs happiness) will help. Furthermore, if any critical info is conveyed by color (say a red flashing border when in critical state), we’ll accompany it with an icon or text for clarity. The resizable window is itself an accessibility feature, allowing users to scale up the pet if they have difficulty seeing small images. If we include any sound alerts, we will accompany them with visual cues (and vice versa) to support users with hearing impairments. Essentially, we adhere to **Microsoft UI accessibility guidelines** so that WindowGotchi can be enjoyed by all. Mod-ability (discussed next) will also consider accessibility – e.g. custom skins should include description metadata, etc., if possible.

* **Mod-ability:** A major adaptation for a modern app is the potential for community-driven content. We plan WindowGotchi to be **moddable** to a reasonable extent. This means users can customize or extend their virtual pet beyond the confines of the default design. At minimum, we will allow **skinning**: the pixel art sprite sheets and maybe sound files will be external resources that users can swap out (with guidelines on dimensions and format). For instance, one could create a custom sprite set to turn WindowGotchi into a different creature (a cat, dragon, etc.) as long as they provide all the required animation frames. We’ll provide documentation or templates for this. The app might load such assets from a “skins” directory. We might also allow customizing certain parameters via config files – e.g. adjust how quickly hunger drops (some might want a slower-paced pet). This all fosters a community similar to how fans made custom “Shimeji” desktop mascots. We will ensure that mods cannot break the core app security: for example, if using scripting, we’d sandbox it. Initially, we’ll likely keep mod-ability to art/sound swaps and basic parameter tweaks. In future, possibly expose more advanced hooks (maybe a plugin system or an API where advanced users can script new behaviors). The mod-ability is entirely optional and for hobbyists; the out-of-the-box experience will be fully functional with the default pet.

* **State Persistence:** Underpinning all these adaptations is robust **state persistence**. WindowGotchi will continuously maintain the pet’s state (life stage, current hearts, discipline, etc.) in memory and periodically save it to disk (for example, a JSON or binary save file in the user’s AppData folder). We will save immediately before critical moments: on graceful exit, on system suspend, and perhaps at regular intervals (e.g. every 5 minutes) to guard against crashes or power loss. The save will include a timestamp of last update so we know how much real time passed when resuming. On app launch, we check if there’s an existing pet. If yes, we load it so the user continues where they left off. If the pet had died previously, we might present the “egg” screen to start a new one. Persistence ensures that even if you reboot your PC, your WindowGotchi resumes its life seamlessly, rather than starting over. We will also handle edge cases like device time changes (if the clock shifts dramatically or user changes time zone, we may ignore that for pet aging to avoid bizarre jumps). Ensuring state is saved across sleep cycles addresses one of the key differences between a battery-powered toy that’s *always on* and a desktop that isn’t – we don’t want an “oops, my computer was off and now my pet is gone” scenario. In summary, WindowGotchi adapts the Tamagotchi mechanics to a desktop by preserving their intent (care and response loop) but tuning frequency and adding OS integration conveniences, all while introducing new capabilities that the PC platform affords (resizable graphics, notifications, mods, etc.). The result will be a virtual pet that feels at home on Windows 10/11, engaging but not irritating, nostalgic yet enhanced for modern users.

## 3. Product Design Document (PDD)

### A. Vision & Personas

**Vision Statement:** WindowGotchi is a **desktop virtual pet with personality**, blending the nostalgic charm of Tamagotchi with the friendly whimsy of Microsoft’s Clippy. It lives in a small window on your screen, providing moments of delight and companionship throughout the workday. Our vision is to create a **personal desktop companion** that the user can care for over time – encouraging short breaks and emotional investment – without significantly disrupting their workflow. WindowGotchi should feel alive: it reacts to user actions, expresses needs and emotions in a cute pixel-art form, and gradually grows and changes based on how it’s cared for. Ultimately, it brings a bit of life to the desktop, making technology feel more personal and fun.

**Target Personas:** We identify two primary personas for WindowGotchi:

* **Nostalgic Nurturer (Persona 1):** Alex is a 30-something professional who fondly remembers playing with Tamagotchis (or similar virtual pets) in childhood. Alex spends long hours on a computer for work. They seek a light-hearted distraction to brighten their day – something that reminds them of simpler times. For Alex, WindowGotchi is a stress reliever and a nostalgia trip. They will diligently feed and play with the pet during coffee breaks and smile at its retro pixel antics. This persona values authenticity (they appreciate that the pet behaves like the classic Tamagotchi) and subtlety (it shouldn’t embarrass them if it pops up during work). Alex represents users who will form an emotional bond with the pet and likely try to keep it alive as long as possible, possibly even sharing stories or screenshots of their pet’s growth.

* **Curious Companion-Seeker (Persona 2):** Jamie is a student and a tech-savvy gamer who spends a lot of time on their PC for both study and entertainment. They weren’t necessarily around for the 90s Tamagotchi craze, but they love the concept of virtual pets in games and find the idea of a **desktop mascot** intriguing. Jamie wants something interactive on their second monitor while gaming, or a companion that reacts to them. They might also enjoy tweaking or modding it – e.g. swapping in a custom sprite for fun. This persona is likely to experiment: they might intentionally see what happens if they neglect the pet, or try out mods from the community. They value **customization and features** (achievements, Easter eggs, etc.) and will give feedback on what new features could be cool. Jamie represents the modern virtual pet enthusiast who will push the product to its limits and engage with community (Discord, etc.) around it.

Secondary personas could include: casual users who just want a funny **“office buddy”** (maybe only care for it sporadically, more for occasional amusement) and even younger users who discover it as a free toy on their family computer. Overall, the product must balance the needs of dedicated caretakers and casual dabblers. The vision is that each user, regardless of persona, feels a little less alone at their computer – the pet provides **emotional engagement**, routine, and a dash of personality in an otherwise utilitarian PC experience.

### B. Competitive Landscape

Digital pets and desktop mascots have appeared in various forms over the years. To position WindowGotchi, we examine both **classic virtual pets** and **desktop-based companions**:

* **Handheld Virtual Pets:** The original **Tamagotchi (1996)** and its successors are the direct inspiration. They established the core features (feeding, cleaning, discipline, life cycle) that WindowGotchi will emulate. Other keychain pets like **Nano Pets** and **Digimon Digital Monsters** also proved the appeal of nurturing a portable creature. More recently, mobile games such as *My Tamagotchi Forever* and *Pou* (a popular smartphone pet app) have modernized the concept for phones, adding color graphics and longer-term progression. These mobile apps are competitors in the broader virtual pet space – they offer rich experiences but are confined to mobile platforms. WindowGotchi differentiates by being *desktop-focused*, providing a companion during PC use, which these others do not.

* **Desktop Mascots (PC predecessors):** There’s a lineage of fun desktop “pets” and assistants on computers. One of the earliest was **Neko** (an 1980s–90s program featuring a little cat chasing the mouse cursor) – it didn’t require feeding, but it was essentially a moving pet on the screen. **Microsoft Office’s Clippy (1997)** is another infamous example: not a pet, but a talking paperclip assistant that would pop up with hints and playful animations. Clippy is remembered for its strong personality – sometimes too intrusive – but it showed how an on-screen character could engage users. We aim to capture Clippy’s **charm (humor and personification)** while avoiding its annoyance factor. There were also friendly mascots like **BonziBuddy (1999)**, a purple gorilla that told jokes and facts. BonziBuddy, however, became known for its adware/spyware nature, which hurt user trust. This is a lesson: our product must **respect the user** (no unsolicited network activity or spammy behavior) to maintain trust. Another example is **Shimeji**, an unofficial desktop mascot platform that became popular with anime characters – little figures wander on your desktop and can be interacted with, and fans can add custom characters. Shimeji demonstrates demand for mod-ability and user-generated content in desktop pets. **Desktop Goose (2020)** was a recent viral hit – a pixelated goose that runs around messing up your desktop (dragging notes, honking). It’s more of a chaotic prank pet and notably “does not need to be fed or taken care of” – essentially an anti-productivity nuisance for laughs. Desktop Goose’s popularity showed that people enjoy a bit of interactive chaos, but as a sustained pet it lacks the nurturing aspect. WindowGotchi will occupy a middle ground: more structured and caring-focused than Desktop Goose, but more playful and visually engaging than the utilitarian 90s office assistants.

* **Modern Virtual Companions:** Beyond pets, we also have voice- or AI-based companions like **Amazon’s Alexa and Microsoft’s Cortana**, but those are utilitarian assistants without a cute persona. On the gaming side, titles like *The Sims* or *Animal Crossing* offer pet or life simulation on larger scales, but not as an always-on desktop presence. There are also a few indie projects like **eSheep** (a 90s desktop sheep that walks around) and newer ones on itch.io that attempt Tamagotchi-like widgets. None have become mainstream on desktop, often due to limited functionality or OS compatibility issues. This is an opportunity: by leveraging a robust framework and focusing on Windows 10/11 support, WindowGotchi can emerge as the go-to desktop pet.

In summary, WindowGotchi’s competitive advantage will be combining the **proven Tamagotchi care gameplay** (which gives it depth and purpose) with the **desktop mascot format** (which offers real-time interaction on the user’s screen). It will do so in a polished, user-respecting way (no spam, minimal resources) which addresses the pitfalls that sank some predecessors (like BonziBuddy’s malware issues or Clippy’s intrusiveness). We will also encourage community engagement (like Shimeji did) through mods and sharing pet stories, which can drive interest and longevity. Given that no major desktop pet has dominated the scene in recent years, WindowGotchi can fill that niche by learning from all these prior examples – essentially becoming the **“Tamagotchi for the desktop generation.”**

### C. Feature Set

WindowGotchi’s features can be grouped into the core gameplay loop, progression elements, and feedback systems:

**Core Gameplay Loop:** The primary loop is **Care → Feedback → Response**. The user must regularly **care** for their pet:

* **Feeding:** Provide meals or treats when the pet is hungry.
* **Playing:** Engage in mini-games to keep the pet happy.
* **Cleaning:** Remove waste to keep the pet healthy.
* **Healing:** Give medicine when the pet falls ill.
* **Disciplining:** Scold the pet when it misbehaves.

These actions mirror the Tamagotchi core loop, creating a routine that might take just a minute or two of the user’s time every so often. The pet in turn gives **Feedback** on its needs: visual (empty heart icons, sad expressions), textual (notifications or speech bubbles like “I’m hungry!”), and audio (chirps or sound cues). The user **Responds** by performing the appropriate care action via the interface (clicking a button, keyboard shortcut, or tray menu item). Upon response, the pet reacts happily (hearts refill, pet might do a cheerful animation) – giving a sense of accomplishment. This loop repeats continuously, forming the daily “heartbeat” of interaction.

**Progression & Evolution:** Over time, the user sees their pet **grow and evolve** as a reward for good care. After successful care for a certain duration, the pet reaches the next stage (baby → child, etc.), possibly even transforming into different forms depending on how well it was cared for. This progression provides medium-term goals: e.g., *“Keep the baby alive for an hour to see it grow into a child”*, *“Raise discipline to get the rare adult character”*. We will implement multiple possible adult outcomes (all in the 2D pixel art style) to encourage replay and experimentation. Additionally, we may include a simple **achievement system** or **badges** (“Longevity: kept pet alive 10 days”, “Perfect Care: no care mistakes in one life span”, etc.) to further gamify progression for enthusiasts. These are optional goals that cater to the competitive or completionist users. Another progression vector is the **Training/Discipline meter** – as it fills up, it could unlock new pet behaviors (for instance, a fully trained pet might do a special trick animation or require less frequent discipline calls). We’ll also have **weight management** as in Tamagotchi: overfeeding increases weight; we might show the pet get visibly chubbier if overfed, which can prompt users to play more games (since exercise in Tamagotchi often lowers weight). If weight crosses certain thresholds, it could influence evolution or health, adding another layer of progression (managing an optimal weight range).

**Feedback & Satisfaction:** It’s crucial that the user feels rewarded for caring for the pet. We will have a variety of **feedback mechanisms**:

* **Visual feedback:** The pet has a range of animations and expressions – e.g., a happy dance when fed a favorite food, a sad slump when neglected, a “sick” look when ill (maybe little sweat drops or a green face). Also, hearts meters visible in the UI give instant feedback on status. If the user opens the detailed status panel, they can see numeric stats (age, weight, etc.) update after actions, reinforcing progress.
* **Audio feedback:** Short sound effects for positive actions (a little chime when a heart is filled, a playful sound when winning a game) and distinct alerts for problems (a “blip” or gentle alarm when hearts empty). The sounds will be chosen to be pleasant and not jarring (we avoid loud buzzers – maybe use retro 8-bit sound for charm).
* **Narrative feedback:** The Clippy-like persona will occasionally comment. For example, after feeding, the pet might say in a text bubble, “Yum, thank you!” or after playing a game, “That was fun!” Conversely, if ignored for long, it might whine “Hellooo? I’m starving...” in the notification. These little bits of dialogue personalize the experience and make the feedback loop more engaging than just silent meters. We must, however, tune the frequency so it doesn’t become annoying chatter.
* **Progress feedback:** When the pet evolves, we’ll make it a moment – possibly a little **evolution animation** (like a pixel fade-out and new form fade-in) and a notification “Your pet grew into a Child stage!” This milestone feedback gives users a sense of achievement and motivates continued care. Similarly, if the pet reaches end-of-life, we handle it respectfully – perhaps the pet says “Goodbye” in a message and an animation plays as in Tamagotchi, followed by an option to hatch a new egg. Providing closure is important to the user’s emotional journey with the pet.

**Secondary Features:** We plan some secondary interactions to enrich the experience:

* **Multiple Pet Options:** While MVP will have one species, in the future we could allow choosing a pet type (each with its own sprite set and evolution outcomes). This is a stretch goal, but it adds replayability and user choice.
* **Customization:** The user might customize the pet’s name (some Tamagotchi versions allowed naming the pet). We can allow the user to name their WindowGotchi, and use that name in notifications (“Fluffy is hungry!”). Cosmetic customization like background wallpaper of the pet’s window, or hats/accessories for the pet earned via good care, can be fun rewards.
* **Social/Sharing Element:** Not a core feature, but we could incorporate a way to share your pet’s status – e.g. a one-click screenshot button or a log of your pet’s age and achievements. This taps into the nostalgic community aspect (people used to compare their Tamagotchis on the playground; now they might share on Twitter). We won’t have a networked multiplayer in v1.0 (e.g., original Tamagotchi had device-to-device IR connections; that’s out-of-scope initially), but we won’t rule out future features like trading pets or visiting friends’ pets if there’s demand.
* **Notifications in Depth:** Possibly allow the user to schedule certain interactions – for example, a daily reminder at lunch if they want to feed their pet at that time (like a routine). This can integrate with Windows’ notification scheduling.

All features are designed to support the core loop of caring and give the user a sense of **companionship and accomplishment**. Even when the user is just working and the pet is idle, its presence is a feature: it might bounce or look around to remind you it’s there (idle animation), giving a subtle sense of life in the corner of your screen.

### D. Interaction Design

WindowGotchi’s interaction design focuses on making the pet easy to interact with in a windowed environment, and ensuring the pet’s personality comes through via animations and sounds.

**Window & UI States:** The application will primarily run in a **single window** that contains the pet and basic UI elements. We envision a **compact view** and an **expanded view**:

* In **compact view**, the window might just show the pet’s pixel art and perhaps tiny icons (hunger, happiness, etc.) or none at all for a minimalist look. This view is like having the pet “sit” on your desktop with minimal distraction – ideal for when you’re working but still want to see the pet. The window can be kept small (say 150×150 px) and possibly set “always on top” if the user wants the pet always visible.
* The user can toggle to **expanded view** (perhaps by double-clicking the window or using a maximize button on the pet’s window). In expanded view, the window is larger and shows the full interface: the pet sprite, plus UI controls (feed, play, etc.), and status readouts (hearts, meters). Think of this as opening the Tamagotchi’s menu. In this state, the user can perform all actions easily via clicking on clear buttons or icons (with labels on hover). We might design it such that the compact view has hidden controls that appear on hover – for example, when your cursor hovers over the pet window, small buttons fade in around it (a bowl icon for feed, a ball icon for play, etc.), and fade out when not needed. This keeps the UI clean.

**User Input & Controls:** Interaction will be primarily **point-and-click**:

* Clicking the feed button will produce a small submenu to choose **Meal or Snack** (since Tamagotchi had two food types). The pet will then do an eating animation.
* Clicking play will start the mini-game. The game can be played with mouse or keyboard (e.g., press left/right arrow or click left/right buttons to guess direction, replicating the original game mechanic). The game will play out in the pet’s window (with the pet sprite doing the animations). This is a modal state within the app – while playing, other actions are paused.
* Discipline might be a single button (like an exclamation "!" icon). If the pet needs discipline (misbehaving), clicking it triggers the scolding animation/sound; if the pet doesn’t need it, clicking discipline could either do nothing or prompt a playful message (“No need to scold now”). We’ll likely disable or hide the discipline button except when applicable to avoid confusion.
* Cleaning is a one-click action (click the poop icon or a “broom” icon when poop is present). Possibly we can allow simply clicking on the poop graphic itself to clean it – intuitive direct manipulation.
* Medicine similarly is one click on a medicine icon when the pet is sick.

For quick access, especially when the window is minimized or in tray, we will support **global shortcuts or tray menu**: e.g., right-click tray icon > “Feed” to quickly feed without opening the window (this will feed a default meal). Or if the pet triggers a Windows notification (“Pet is hungry \[Feed it]”), we can add an action button on the toast notification itself that says “Feed Now” which, if clicked, will send the feed command without even opening the app (leveraging the notification action API). This is a very modern interaction that streamlines care for power users.

**Animations & Visual Feedback:** WindowGotchi will feature smooth (but still pixelated) animations for the pet. We’ll design a sprite sheet for each major action: eating (e.g., pet opens mouth, a food appears, etc.), playing (dancing or making faces), happy jump, sad crying, sleeping (with little “Z” bubbles perhaps), and more. The animations will run at a modest frame rate consistent with pixel art (maybe 4–8 frames per second for a retro feel). The pet’s **idle animation** is important too – when nothing is happening, the pet might blink, look around, or walk back and forth in its window. It might also interact with the window borders (like bounce off edges or peek out) for charm. If possible, we’ll incorporate some **contextual animations**: for instance, if you drag the pet’s window, maybe the pet sprite appears to stumble or get annoyed (like “hey, I’m walking here!” expression). These little touches add life and Clippy-like humor. Speaking of Clippy, we might borrow an idea: Clippy used to morph or use props (turn into a bicycle, etc.). We could have a few fun Easter egg animations for WindowGotchi that trigger rarely or on special days (e.g., on the pet’s “birthday” – one year since you started – it throws confetti).

**Sound Design:** The audio will complement interactions. When the pet is clicked or petted (if we allow clicking on the pet as an interaction), it could make a cute chirp or say a fun line. During feeding, a munch sound; during cleaning, maybe a flush or sparkle sound; discipline might be a comedic “boing” or a scold noise. All sounds will be short (under a second) and have a retro game vibe (8-bit or 16-bit style), to keep with the pixel theme. We will provide an option to turn off sound or adjust volume if needed. Possibly also an option for “office mode” where all sound and certain animations are muted during work hours.

**Error Handling & User Guidance:** The UI will be designed to be intuitive enough that hopefully little explicit guidance is needed (Tamagotchi itself had cryptic icon-based UI, but we have the luxury of tooltips and labels). However, we’ll include a simple **tutorial or help**. For example, the first time you run WindowGotchi, it hatches an egg and the pet might introduce itself via a dialogue box: “Hi, I’m your new pet! Here’s how to take care of me...” with a few arrows pointing to the feed and play buttons. We can also include a help menu or link to an online manual. For ongoing guidance, the pet’s personality will offer hints: if the pet is hungry and you haven’t responded, it might eventually say “Maybe you should click the bowl icon?” as a clue. If an invalid action is attempted (like feeding when pet is full), we’ll feedback with something like the pet shaking its head “no” to clearly indicate that action isn’t allowed now.

**States & Transitions:** There are distinct states: Normal, Attention Needed, Sleeping, Playing (minigame), and possibly Paused. We’ll visualize these clearly:

* **Normal:** Pet is content, wandering or idling. UI minimal.
* **Attention Needed:** Pet sprite might change (e.g. crying or an icon thought bubble of food), the window might pulse or the border might glow red, and a notification is likely to be fired. The attention icon (like a little indicator light in UI) can also appear. This state persists until user does the needed action or the 15-minute period lapses (entering care mistake).
* **Sleeping:** The window could dim and show the pet curled up with “Zzz”. The lights toggle (if present) will be off. In this state, most interactions are disabled (maybe clicking will gently wake it if absolutely needed, but that should be discouraged).
* **Playing Minigame:** The UI becomes the game interface for a short time. We might show a number guessing or left/right prompt and record the user’s input. The pet’s reactions (happy for win, disappointed for loss) show after each round. After 5 rounds, we exit game state back to normal with updated happiness.
* **Paused:** If we implement a manual pause, in this state we might overlay a “PAUSED” text on the pet’s window. The pet could freeze or snooze. No time passes, no notifications; basically a static state. User can unpause via a menu or button.

**Clippy-Style Personality Integration:** Throughout the design, we incorporate a persona for the pet. It will have a name (perhaps default name, user changeable). It speaks in first person in notifications (“I am hungry” instead of “Pet is hungry”) to anthropomorphize it. The tone is friendly, a bit cheeky but not insulting. Clippy was often perceived as obnoxious because it interrupted with irrelevant suggestions. WindowGotchi will avoid that by only “interrupting” when it actually needs something or when the user explicitly engages with it. We might program a few *optional* fun interactions – e.g., if the user types certain words on their keyboard, the pet reacts (just as Clippy popped up when you wrote a letter in Word: maybe if it sees you working late it says “Don’t forget to feed me (and yourself)!”). But these will be subtle and can be turned off if unwanted. The character’s personality can be described as: **playful, cute, occasionally sassy but ultimately loving**. We want the user to feel affection for it, similar to how one would for a real pet or a well-written game character. The design of interactions ensures the pet is usually a source of joy, not frustration – a design priority gleaned from Clippy’s failure (Clippy was helpful but often not needed; our pet’s needs are genuine within the pet sim context, so its interruptions are more forgivable and anticipated).

In summary, the interaction design focuses on **seamlessness** (easy clicks, intuitive icons, tray integration) and **character** (animations, sounds, and dialogues that bring the pet to life). It ensures that caring for the pet is as easy as possible, while also making the pet’s reactions enjoyable to watch.

### E. System Architecture

The system architecture of WindowGotchi will be organized into a modular front-end application with a clear separation of concerns between the **core pet simulation logic** and the **user interface/OS integration**. We have evaluated various technology stacks (Electron, Tauri, WinUI, Flutter) for implementing the desktop app and recommend using **Tauri** with a web-based UI for WindowGotchi’s implementation. Tauri is a modern framework that pairs a lightweight Rust backend with a front-end built in web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS). This choice aligns with our priorities: it yields a very small binary (\~**<10MB** vs potentially 100MB+ in Electron) and low memory footprint (Tauri apps can idle around 150–200MB RAM, compared to \~500MB for Electron), which is important for something meant to run continuously in the background. Tauri also has first-class support for Windows features like notifications and tray icons, and built-in auto-update support, reducing our implementation effort.

**Front-end Stack:** In this Tauri-based approach, the **UI layer** will be a web UI. We can use a JavaScript/TypeScript framework such as **React** or **Vue** to build the interactive interface, or even keep it lightweight with vanilla JS since the UI is relatively simple. The UI will render the pixel art pet (using either `<canvas>` or simply animating `<img>` frames) and include HTML buttons/icons for actions. CSS can handle scaling (with `image-rendering: pixelated` for crisp enlargement). This gives us flexibility in designing the interface and leveraging existing web libraries (for animations, sound playback, etc.). The UI communicates with the back-end (Rust) via Tauri’s messaging system (IPC) for any privileged operations (like file system access for saving state, or triggering a toast notification). Much of the pet logic can actually reside in the front-end as well (written in TypeScript), which might simplify things since the UI can directly update based on game logic without crossing the IPC boundary frequently. We will likely implement the core pet simulation (timers, stat updates) in the front-end code for responsiveness, and use the Rust side primarily for system integration (notifications, tray, saving to disk).

**Core Logic (Pet Simulation):** The Tamagotchi simulation is essentially a deterministic state machine managing the pet’s stats and life cycle. We will implement a **Pet Model** (as a class or module) that encapsulates all pet data: current age, stage, hunger level, happiness level, discipline level, etc., plus methods to perform actions (feed, play, etc.) and to tick time forward. This could be done in TypeScript (making use of types for safety) on the front-end. For example, a `Pet` class with a `update(deltaTime)` method that reduces hearts based on elapsed time and triggers events (like illness or evolution) when conditions are met. This core will be thoroughly unit-tested (even outside the UI) to ensure accuracy to the Tamagotchi specs. The parameters (rates, thresholds from Section 1) will be configurable constants in this module, which will make it easier to adjust balancing or allow mods to tweak them.

**Timing and Event Loop:** In a desktop app, we don’t want to use too much CPU, so we won’t run a game loop at high FPS constantly. Instead, we can use **timers**. For example, set an interval to tick the pet’s clock every minute (60000 ms) – each tick reduces hunger/happy by some fraction or handles scheduled events like poop drop. Additionally, we’ll schedule specific future events like “next poop time” or “next heart decrease” and use timers for those. Using the browser’s `setTimeout`/`setInterval` in the web context or Rust’s event loop, we can efficiently manage these timed events. If the app is suspended (which pauses JS timers), the backend on resume will catch up (we can compute the gap using real time difference and call multiple ticks as needed).

**Persistence Layer:** The app will maintain a **save file** on disk (for instance, a JSON file at `%APPDATA%/WindowGotchi/pet_state.json` on Windows). This file stores all persistent data: pet’s stats, last timestamp, user settings, etc. On startup, the Rust backend can read this file and pass the data to the front-end to initialize the Pet model. Conversely, periodically and on exit, the front-end sends the current state to the backend to save. Tauri allows writing files via Rust safely. We’ll ensure this write is atomic (write to a temp file then rename, or similar) to avoid corruption. We may also implement a backup system (keep the last known good save) in case something goes wrong. The persistence design accounts for potential cross-platform differences in file paths (Tauri can abstract that). Additionally, if we ever allow cloud sync or multi-device in future, having a single state file makes it conceptually easier to sync via an external service (though initially, no cloud – just local).

**System/OS Integration:** Using Tauri’s APIs or plugins, we will integrate:

* **Notifications:** Tauri on Windows can use the Windows 10/11 notification API to send toasts. We’ll call this from the Rust side whenever the front-end requests a notification (e.g. `notify("Pet is hungry!")`). The notification will have actions like “Feed now” – if clicked, we route that to the front-end to execute a feed action immediately.
* **Tray Icon:** Tauri provides a way to create a tray icon with a context menu. We’ll initialize a tray icon on app start (maybe showing an egg or pet face icon). The context menu items (Feed, Pause, Quit, etc.) will be defined in Rust and wired to send messages to the front-end or perform directly (e.g. Quit can directly exit). The tray icon can also reflect state – while not dynamic image (unless we replace it), we can show a badge count or tooltip text like “Pet needs you!” by changing the icon’s tooltip or using flashing (some OS allow that) if urgent.
* **Auto-Updates:** We will integrate Tauri’s auto-update system (which can check a GitHub releases feed or custom server). The Rust side periodically checks for an update, downloads it, then on next launch the new version runs. We’ll wrap this in a user-friendly manner (maybe the pet will say “Installing my new toys…” during update). This sub-system will be mostly handled by the framework, we just configure the feed URL and sign the releases appropriately.
* **Power events:** We can use Rust’s Windows API access to listen for suspend/resume (WM\_POWERBROADCAST messages). When detected, we will trigger save/pause as described. On resume, possibly send a message to front-end to adjust timers or simulate catch-up. WinUI or Flutter would handle this differently, but in Tauri/Rust we’ll likely rely on OS event hooks or simply on the fact that when resumed, the difference in last saved timestamp vs current time can be calculated.

**Technology Alternatives Discussion:** If we had chosen **Electron**, architecture would be similar (with a main process in Node.js handling OS integration and a renderer process running the pet UI). Electron has the advantage of huge community and plugin support for things like tray, but the heavy resource usage is a downside. We opted for Tauri as it covers those needs in a lighter package. **WinUI 3** was considered: it would mean writing the app in C# or C++ with XAML UI. That offers native performance and Fluent design integration, and direct use of Windows APIs. However, it ties us to Windows only (cross-platform would require a separate codebase or using something like Uno Platform) and a steeper learning curve for modern devs more familiar with web. WinUI could be an option if we targeted the Microsoft Store, but Tauri apps can also be packaged for the Store if needed. **Flutter** is another cross-platform approach (Dart language). It can make beautiful UIs and has good Windows support now, but it adds another language (Dart) for our team to manage, and the binary sizes are moderate (\~20MB minimal). Flutter’s custom rendering might actually be great for pixel art control, but we felt the web stack (HTML5 Canvas) is perfectly capable and more accessible. So, Tauri gives us cross-platform future (Mac/Linux packaging down the line) while optimizing for Windows first.

**System Components & Dependencies:**

* **Front-end (web)**: HTML/CSS/JS, plus possibly frameworks like React, and libraries (e.g. GreenSock for animations or Howler.js for audio if needed).
* **Back-end (Rust via Tauri)**: We will use the Tauri API for FS, notifications, tray, and an embedded WebView (which on Windows uses WebView2/Edge). We might include some Rust crates for ease (e.g. serde for JSON serialization of state, chrono for time).
* **Testing Frameworks:** For logic testing, we can write unit tests in JavaScript (using Jest or similar for the TS logic) and in Rust for any Rust components. We aim for high coverage on the critical logic (pet simulation, etc.).
* **CI/CD:** Using GitHub Actions, we’ll set up continuous integration to run tests for both the front-end (JS tests) and back-end (Rust tests) on each push, and possibly even build installers on tag releases.

**Security Considerations:** Tauri is secure by design (it has a tight scope for what the web code can do natively, everything else must go through vetted commands). We will ensure that our app doesn’t require excessive permissions. The user’s data (pet state) is not sensitive but we will still protect it and not collect any personal info. No networking is needed except update checks; we will clearly inform users of that. By keeping architecture simple (no arbitrary code execution, etc.), we minimize risks.

**Performance:** The app logic is lightweight (few calculations per minute), and the graphics are simple (pixel art, which even with scaling is trivial for modern GPUs). Memory usage will be mainly the WebView overhead. On CPU, we expect near-zero use when idle (timers and occasional animations) – we will verify that no busy loops exist. The Rust side might spawn a thread for periodic tasks, but also very light. We’ll test with tools to ensure WindowGotchi doesn’t become a resource hog over time (no memory leaks in the long run, etc.). The system architecture allows us to decouple concerns such that, for instance, updating the UI (render loop for animation) can be separate from game logic tick events, ensuring smooth visuals.

In summary, the architecture is a **hybrid app** with a *web frontend for UI/logic* and a *native backend for OS integration*, using Tauri to glue them. It emphasizes modularity: the **Pet simulation module** is distinct and testable, the **Persistence** is centralized, and the **OS interface** is abstracted. This will facilitate both parallel development (team members can work on the pet logic vs. UI vs. integration somewhat independently) and future maintainability (e.g., swapping the UI framework or adding a new platform should not require re-writing core logic).

### F. Art & Audio Style Guide

WindowGotchi will adopt a cohesive retro aesthetic in both visuals and sound to pay homage to its Tamagotchi roots while ensuring the art scales and looks appealing on modern screens. Below is the style guide for art and audio:

**Art Style:** All visuals will be done in **2D pixel art**. The style is reminiscent of 90s 8-bit/16-bit console sprites, but we are not limited to the original Tamagotchi’s extremely low resolution. We will create the pet and related graphics in a slightly higher base resolution so they’re more expressive. For example, we might design the pet sprite at **64×64 pixels** (as opposed to the original P1 Tamagotchi characters which effectively fit in \~32×32 or less). This allows us to show limb movement, facial expressions, etc., with a bit more detail while still clearly being pixelated. We will use a **limited color palette**, both for nostalgia and clarity. Possibly something like a 16-color palette for the pet itself. We may choose colors inspired by Tamagotchi (often black and white or simple tones) or go for a GameBoy Color vibe (a few pastel colors). Importantly, because Windows UI can have any background, our pet sprite will likely have transparency around it (so it can be overlaid on the window background or move around). The window background itself could be a solid color or simple pattern; if we allow changing it, we’ll provide a few retro patterns (grid, dots, etc.) or plain options.

**Characters & Animation:** The main pet design will be **cute and iconic**. For instance, if we create a default character, perhaps it’s a round-bodied creature with big eyes – simple enough to be drawn in pixels but distinctive. We’ll ensure it’s not too derivative of Bandai’s proprietary characters to avoid IP issues (so we won’t copy “Mametchi” exactly, but we might be inspired by its simplicity and cuteness). Each life stage will have a different sprite (egg, baby, etc.), and multiple possible adult forms means multiple sprite sets. All these should look like they’re part of the same “species family” in art style (same palette, similar shapes). Animation frames will be hand-pixelled. We’ll define a frame size (maybe 64×64 or 80×80 if needed to accommodate accessories). The frame rate can be low (\~4-6 FPS for normal animation) to keep that jerky retro charm. Some faster actions can use more frames but still we’ll cap around 12 FPS at most. Key animations we’ll produce: idle blinking, walking, eating (with food sprite), playing (maybe an animation of facing left/right for the guessing game), reacting happy, reacting sad, sick (with a skull bubble or sweat drop), sleeping (eyes closed with Z symbol). We’ll also animate UI elements in pixel style – e.g., when a heart fills, it might “blink” or a tiny pixel heart pops up. If any transitions (like evolve) are done, we could do a pixel dissolve effect (random pixels scattering) which is easy to do programmatically or via a sprite sequence.

**Resolution & Scaling:** As mentioned, the assets will be designed for a base size and then scaled up in-app as needed. We will provide 1× assets (original pixel size) and use nearest-neighbor scaling to preserve sharp edges. For extremely high DPI or if a user wants the pet huge, we could consider drawing assets at 2× resolution as well and switching, but since pixel art looks fine scaled up, it’s not strictly necessary. What’s crucial is that the application is **pixel-perfect** – no blurry upscaling. We’ll test on various DPI settings in Windows to confirm the rendering is crisp. Also, we will ensure the art looks good on both light and dark backgrounds. Perhaps the window background behind the pet will default to a neutral tone to give good contrast. We’ll also design an app icon (likely pixel art egg or pet face) that looks good in small sizes for the taskbar/tray; perhaps draw it at 32×32 and then let Windows downscale to 16×16 etc., tweaking as needed.

**Color Palette & Licensing:** The chosen color palette will be consistent. If we go with a monochrome pet (like original Tamagotchi were just black pixel on LCD), we might spice it up by having the pet one color (like green or blue) with black outline, etc. Alternatively, we can allow full color – maybe the pet is a few bright colors (like Kirby-like or a little monster). Whichever we choose, we stick to flat colors (no gradients or anti-aliasing in the sprites, to maintain authenticity). The assets we create will be **original** and we’ll license them appropriately (likely as part of our software’s copyright). If we incorporate any third-party pixel art (for example, if using a free pixel font for any numbers, or using open-source icon designs for UI), we will ensure they are under permissible licenses (CC0, MIT, etc.) and attribute if required. The majority of art will be custom-made by our team’s artist or sourced from open art communities if needed (there are free Tamagotchi-like sprite sets out there, but to avoid legal issues we prefer original art inspired by those). The style guide will document color codes and pixel proportions for consistency, especially if multiple artists contribute. For example, define outline style (maybe black outline around pet or not?), shadow style (perhaps none or simple drop shadow as a separate sprite if needed).

**UI Art:** The UI elements (buttons, icons) will also follow a pixel art motif. Instead of default system buttons, we might design custom pixel icons: e.g., a tiny pixel art burger for the Feed button, a smiley face for Happiness or a joystick for Play, a bandage or red cross for Medicine, etc. These will be about 16×16 or 24×24 pixel icons, enlarged in the app. Font-wise, if we display text (like the pet’s name or status numbers), we might use a **pixel font** (bitmap font) to stay in theme. There are many free pixel fonts that resemble old game text. This would apply to maybe the age/weight display or maybe speech bubble text. Alternatively, we could use a modern font but stylized; a pixel font would really cement the retro feel though. We must ensure readability, so for any body text (like help text) we’ll use a normal easy-to-read font.

**Audio Style:** The audio should complement the retro aesthetic. We will use **chiptune-like sound effects**. This can be achieved by either finding existing free sound FX (there are libraries of pixel-art game SFX) or creating them using tools (a tool like Bfxr can generate 8-bit style bleeps and bloops easily). For example, a feed action might play a “blip” sound, a happy event might play a chord from a square wave. We’ll likely pick a sound theme like using Game Boy style (4-channel) or NES style. The volume levels of all sounds will be normalized to avoid any one sound being too loud. We won’t have background music (it would be too distracting for a desktop app running continuously), but maybe we can have a short jingle on special events (like an evolution jingle or a victory tune after a successful mini-game). If we do, it will be a few seconds of chip-tune melody, kept subtle.

**Voice:** We currently don’t plan to have actual voice acting for the pet (like spoken lines), both to avoid repetitive annoyance and to keep things light. If we did add voice, it might be an unintelligible babble (Animal Crossing style) or a synthesized “bleep speech” that hints at words but not clearly. This is something we might experiment with, but text is probably sufficient.

**Licensing (Audio):** Any audio we include will either be original (we can generate simple effects ourselves or via an audio designer) or from free libraries (there are many CC0 retro sound packs). We will document any third-party audio use to ensure license compliance. Given we’re not monetizing, we have flexibility to use non-commercial licensed sounds too, but we’ll aim for fully free/open to avoid issues if the project becomes popular.

**Consistency and Documentation:** The art & sound guide will be documented for contributors. This includes the pixel grid we use, the palette (with hex codes for colors), naming conventions for assets (like sprite\_pet\_adult1\_idle1.png, etc.), and how frames are ordered. Audio documentation will list each sound’s purpose and style (e.g. SFX\_success.wav: 0.5s length, triangle wave). By maintaining this consistency, whenever we add new evolutions or new animations, they’ll fit seamlessly with existing ones. We’ll also incorporate user feedback on art – for instance, ensure the pet’s design is universally appealing (we might do a few concept variants and do a quick poll or tests to see which one people find cutest or least irritating since this pet will be stared at a lot).

**Example Scenario:** When the pet is hungry, its sprite might change to a sad face and it might emit a short “wah” beep in a low bit-rate sound. The feed button (with a pixel burger icon) when clicked triggers an eating animation: a pixelated food item appears, the pet’s mouth opens/closes, and a fun munch sound (maybe a bit-crushed crunch) plays. After feeding, one of the empty heart icons fills in red (with a tiny pop sound and maybe a sparkle animation). All these elements – the pixel visuals, the chiptune sounds – reinforce the classic virtual pet vibe, yet the smoothness of transition and polish makes it **feel at home on a modern OS**. The style guide ensures every asset and sound contributes to this cohesive experience.

### G. Coding Standards & Quality Gates

To build WindowGotchi with reliability and maintainability, we will adhere to strict coding standards and institute quality assurance processes from day one. Our development will primarily use **Python** for logic prototyping and possibly for writing certain modules (especially if we leverage Codex to generate some logic code), alongside the main app implementation languages (TypeScript for front-end, Rust for backend). Regardless of language, we enforce clean, readable, and well-documented code.

**PEP 8 Compliance (Python):** All Python code (for example, if we create simulation prototypes or internal tools, or if parts of the app logic are in Python) will follow **PEP 8** – the official Python style guide. This means using clear naming conventions (snake\_case for functions and variables, CapWords for classes, etc.), proper indentation and line length (generally max 79 characters per line as recommended), and spacing around operators for readability. Consistency is key because code is read much more often than it is written. We’ll use linters/formatters such as **Flake8 or Black** to automatically enforce PEP 8 style, which ensures no dev deviates. The guiding principle is that following PEP 8 will improve code readability and maintain consistency across the project.

**PEP 257 Docstrings:** We will document all modules, classes, and functions with clear **docstrings** per PEP 257. This means every function will have a concise description of its purpose, its parameters, and return values. For example, the `Pet.feed()` method will have a docstring explaining what feeding does, any edge cases (refusal if full), and whether it returns something. These docstrings will not only serve developers but also help generate documentation if we use tools like Sphinx. Adopting PEP 257 conventions (triple quotes, first line summary, etc.) ensures consistency in how documentation is presented.

**Type Hints and Static Typing:** We will make use of **Python type hints** extensively in any Python code (and similarly use TypeScript’s type system for front-end code and Rust’s static types on the backend). This means function signatures will specify types for parameters and return values (e.g. `def feed(self, food_type: str) -> bool:`). To enforce correctness, we integrate **mypy** static type checker into the development process. Mypy allows us to catch type inconsistencies or incorrect usage before runtime. For instance, if a function expects an int and we accidentally pass a string, mypy will flag it. Using type hints turns our code into self-checked documentation, making it easier to understand and maintain. In Rust/TypeScript, the languages are already strongly typed, and we’ll treat compiler warnings as errors to keep those codebases clean too.

**Unit Testing & Coverage:** We will write **unit tests** for all critical modules. Our goal is to achieve at least **80% test coverage** across the codebase. Specifically, the pet simulation logic will be thoroughly tested: e.g., tests for “hunger decreases after 6 minutes,” “feeding increases hunger and weight correctly,” “pet evolves at the right time,” etc., using known values from Tamagotchi guides as assertions. We’ll also test edge cases (max hearts, discipline overflow, death conditions). For Python code, we’ll use **pytest or unittest** to write these tests. We’ll measure coverage with tools like `coverage.py` or `pytest-cov`. Hitting 80% coverage ensures we cover most paths, though our aim is quality over quantity of tests; the 80% figure is a guideline to catch obvious gaps. We recognize that 100% coverage isn’t necessary (or a guarantee of no bugs), but a high coverage forces us to think about various scenarios and increases confidence in each release. Besides logic tests, we’ll also have some integration tests – for example, using something like Selenium or Playwright to simulate button clicks in the UI and see if state changes appropriately (though UI tests can be limited in number due to complexity).

**Continuous Integration (CI):** We will set up a **GitHub Actions** CI pipeline that runs on every push/merge request. This CI will perform multiple jobs:

1. **Linting/Formatting** – run Flake8/Black for Python, ESLint/Prettier for JS, clippy for Rust, etc., to enforce our style rules automatically.
2. **Type Checking** – run mypy on Python code, tsc (TypeScript compiler) on frontend code, and Rust’s `cargo check` for backend to ensure type safety across the project.
3. **Run Test Suite** – execute all unit tests and perhaps integration tests. The CI will fail the build if any test fails, preventing regressions from being merged.
4. **Coverage enforcement** – we can integrate a step to calculate coverage and optionally fail if coverage falls below 80%. Alternatively, at least report coverage in the CI output so we track it over time.
5. **Build Artifacts** – optionally, the CI can also compile the app for Windows (and other platforms as needed) to ensure that changes don’t break the build.

Adopting CI means every code change is validated in a clean environment, catching “it works on my machine” issues early. This fosters a culture where developers run tests locally too, knowing CI will check them, leading to more frequent testing and integration. We’ll also set up **branch protection** so that pull requests must pass CI checks and perhaps require at least one peer code review before merging to main, ensuring quality and shared knowledge of changes.

**Code Reviews:** Speaking of reviews, we will practice regular **peer code reviews**. At least one other developer should review any significant change, checking for correctness, readability, and adherence to standards. This also helps share understanding of the codebase and catch issues a test might not (like unclear naming or potential performance concerns). We’ll use tools like GitHub’s PR review system to comment on specific lines. Code reviews combined with CI act as our quality gate for merging features.

**Version Control & Release Practices:** We will use Git for version control with a branching strategy (e.g. feature branches, stable main branch). We’ll tag releases (v0.1, v1.0, etc.) and possibly adopt semantic versioning. Each release candidate will only be done when tests are green and coverage acceptable. For releases, we might do a final sanity test on a fresh Windows machine (especially to ensure installer, notifications, etc. work properly).

**Coding Standards for Other Languages:** In our multi-language project, we’ll also have standards for TypeScript (we’ll use a linter like ESLint with recommended style – likely aligning with the Airbnb or StandardJS style guide, meaning things like 2-space indentation, semi-colons consistently, etc.). For Rust, we’ll use `rustfmt` for formatting and follow Rust’s API naming conventions (snake\_case for functions, CamelCase for types, etc.). We will also enforce documentation comments in Rust (using `///` for public functions). Though PEP 8 doesn’t directly apply to TS or Rust, the spirit of writing clean, consistent code carries over. We want any developer to easily jump between modules and languages without feeling disoriented by wildly different coding styles.

**Quality Metrics:** Besides test coverage, we’ll watch **cyclomatic complexity** (keeping functions small and focused), and use static analysis (like SonarQube or CodeQL via GitHub) to detect vulnerabilities or code smells. Given the scope, major security issues are unlikely, but tools can catch things like using the file system unsafely or potential null reference errors.

**Documentation & Comments:** We commit to maintaining up-to-date **developer documentation** (in a README or wiki) for setting up the dev environment, understanding module responsibilities, etc. In code, we prefer clear code over many comments, but where logic is not obvious we add comments. We also document any hacks or workarounds clearly, so they can be revisited later.

By enforcing these coding standards and quality gates, we ensure that WindowGotchi’s development is sustainable and its codebase remains **readable, reliable, and refactorable** as the project grows. This reduces bugs and helps onboard any new contributors smoothly, aligning with professional software development best practices.

### H. Risks & Mitigations

Developing and launching WindowGotchi comes with several risks. We identify key risks along with our mitigation strategies:

* **Risk: Over-Notification & User Annoyance.** There is a fine line between a charming virtual pet and an irritating distraction. If WindowGotchi sends too many notifications or interrupts users at the wrong time (like Clippy’s infamous habit), users may get annoyed and uninstall or ignore it. **Mitigation:** We will implement intelligent notification throttling and context awareness. For instance, integrate with Windows Focus Assist – if the user is in presentation mode or Do Not Disturb, the pet will suppress non-critical notifications. We also allow the user to customize frequency (maybe a “low maintenance mode” setting where the pet’s needs go down slower, thus fewer alerts). Additionally, we provide an easy **snooze** or pause function: one-click to put the pet to sleep for a while if the user needs zero distractions (similar to how you could mute a Tamagotchi’s sound if needed). Through user testing, we’ll tune the default notification frequency to err on the side of less intrusive. The persona of the pet’s messages will be kept polite and optional (e.g., if a user doesn’t respond, the pet might eventually quiet down rather than nag endlessly).

* **Risk: Neglect and Pet Death Frustration.** Some users (especially the Nostalgic Nurturers) could be upset if their beloved pet dies while they were away or unable to tend it. Since a PC pet can’t be attended 24/7, the chance of unintended neglect is high. **Mitigation:** As discussed, we have the **pause on system sleep** feature to prevent accidental death. We’ll also consider implementing a grace period: even if hearts empty and time passes, perhaps the pet enters a critical state for a while (sick or very unhappy) rather than instant death, giving the user a chance to save it when they return. Another mitigation is an **“easy mode”** toggle (or as part of initial setup: “Do you want a relaxed pet that can’t die easily, or a challenging pet?”). In easy mode, the pet might never die, it just runs away until you “revive” it, or it stays sick until healed, etc. This ensures casual users or kids don’t face harsh consequences unexpectedly. For users who do lose a pet, we’ll soften the blow with that positive death sequence (the pet’s spirit or offspring lives on, etc.) so it’s not all negative. We also allow them to start a new pet easily. In documentation, we’ll warn that like real pets, neglect can cause the pet to leave, so they should choose their settings accordingly.

* **Risk: Technical Issues – Performance and Resource Use.** If WindowGotchi consumes too much memory or CPU, it could be seen as bloatware (a common complaint for Electron apps) and get negative reception. **Mitigation:** Our choice of Tauri is one major step (minimizes footprint). We will test on low-spec machines to ensure it runs smoothly. We’ll profile the app to eliminate any inefficient loops or memory leaks. Because the app runs continuously, a **memory leak** could be disastrous (memory usage could grow unbounded over days). To mitigate, we will run long soak tests (running the app with simulated usage for days in a row) and use profilers or logging to catch leaks. We will also review third-party libraries for footprint (keeping them minimal – e.g., if using React, ensure production build is optimized, or use Preact if needed for smaller size). Another technical risk is high battery usage on laptops (if the app wakes CPU too often). Mitigation: use timers instead of busy polling, and when pet is idle or paused, we suspend all activity. Essentially, ensure the pet “sleeps” when not needed, mirroring real pet rest.

* **Risk: Software Bugs and Tamagotchi Logic Accuracy.** There is risk that we implement the pet’s behavior incorrectly, causing either too lenient or too harsh conditions, or even crashes in the simulation (e.g., negative heart values, etc.). **Mitigation:** Extensive unit testing (as described in section G) will cover the logic. We’re basing the parameters on well-documented values, and we’ll do iterative testing (including perhaps a beta release to Tamagotchi enthusiast communities to get feedback on accuracy). If any bug arises (say the pet never evolves due to a logic error), we’ll patch it promptly via our update system. Having telemetry (if acceptable) could help detect issues – e.g., if we anonymously track pet ages, we might notice no one’s pet lived beyond age 5 due to a bug. But we have to balance privacy; likely we won’t include telemetry by default since no monetization means no need for data collection. Instead, we’ll rely on user-reported bugs on our GitHub or forum. Quick iteration with auto-updates will mitigate the impact of any logic mistakes.

* **Risk: User Trust and Security.** After experiences like BonziBuddy (which was essentially malware) and other novelty apps, users might be wary installing a desktop pet, fearing it could be spyware or adware. **Mitigation:** We will be very transparent about what the app does. Since we have **no monetization**, we can clearly state we do not collect personal data, serve ads, or do anything beyond the pet simulation. We’ll consider open-sourcing parts of the code (or at least making the community aware of how it works) to build trust. Code signing the application and distributing via reputable channels (like Microsoft Store or GitHub releases) will ensure users’ security software doesn’t flag it. We will also ensure the app requests no elevated permissions – it runs in user mode, only touches a small save file, and uses OS APIs for notifications. By avoiding network access (except update check) and not bundling junk, we differentiate from those bad actors. Our installer/uninstaller will be clean as well.

* **Risk: Intellectual Property (IP) Issues.** Tamagotchi is a trademark of Bandai, and while our app is “inspired” and not a direct clone with their characters, we need to ensure we don’t infringe on copyrights or trademarks. **Mitigation:** We use original artwork and avoid using any Tamagotchi names or graphics. The name “WindowGotchi” is a playful nod but distinct enough; still, we’ll do some due diligence to ensure no conflict. If necessary, we’re prepared to rename the pet or change minor thematic elements to avoid legal problems. We also must ensure any mod content users create doesn’t use protected IP (like someone might mod Pikachu in – that’s on the user’s end, not ours, but we won’t distribute such content ourselves). A related IP risk: if we include community mods in an official capacity, we need to verify their licensing. We’ll mitigate by keeping mods user-side only and not built-in, at least at first.

* **Risk: Feature Creep and Delay.** There’s a risk we attempt to implement too many features (especially stretch ideas like multiple pets, AI chatting, etc.) and that delays the MVP or complicates the app. **Mitigation:** We have clearly defined MVP vs v1.0 vs stretch (see next section). We will prioritize core functionality first – the pet must reliably eat, play, evolve, etc., before we think about any extras. Using an agile approach, we’ll get a basic version in testing early (maybe a closed beta) to validate the concept and fun, then layer additional features. We should avoid adding non-essential features right before release (feature freeze strategy) to ensure stability. This also helps keep the app lightweight; every new feature is weighed against complexity and resource cost.

* **Risk: Cross-Platform Porting Challenges.** Although we focus on Windows initially, we do plan Mac/Linux support. Some features (like Windows toast notifications or tray icon code) may not directly translate. **Mitigation:** By using a cross-platform framework (Tauri), much of our code is already multi-platform. We will abstract platform-specific bits – e.g., on macOS, we’d use the Notification Center for alerts (Tauri will likely handle that similarly) and a different mechanism for tray (macOS has a menu bar extra). We should design the code to check OS at runtime and adapt. We’ll also test on Mac and Linux early after Windows MVP is stable, so we can catch issues (like DPI differences, file system differences) and address them. The risk is moderate, but manageable with planning.

* **Risk: User Retention and Longevity.** Novelty apps can have a surge of interest and then be abandoned. Users might get bored after their pet dies once or after a week of repetition. **Mitigation:** We address this by including progression depth (various evolutions, achievements) to keep goals in sight. Also community features (sharing, mods) help retain interest beyond the initial novelty. Post-launch, we can release periodic updates (new pet types, seasonal events – e.g., a special animation on Halloween) to re-engage users. Since no monetization, our “ROI” is user happiness and community growth. Monitoring user feedback will tell us what features to add to keep them engaged (maybe they want a second pet or some interaction between pets – those could become updates). Essentially, treating it as a living app itself mitigates user churn.

By foreseeing these risks and planning mitigations, we increase the likelihood of WindowGotchi being well-received and sustainable. Regularly revisiting our risk register during development will ensure we adjust our strategy as needed (for example, if we find our notifications still annoy some testers, we’ll refine that further, etc.). Our goal is to deliver a delightful pet with minimal downsides or surprises for the user.

### I. MVP vs. v1.0 vs. Stretch Features

We will approach WindowGotchi’s development in stages, ensuring a solid core product first and then building upon it. Below we outline the scope for the **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**, the full **v1.0 release**, and some **stretch goals** for future versions:

**MVP (Minimum Viable Product):** *This is the initial version we aim to get in users’ hands for feedback.* It focuses on the fundamental pet simulation without all bells and whistles. The MVP includes:

* **Single Pet Life Cycle:** Egg hatching, baby → child → adult evolution with at least one possible adult outcome (we might not implement all multiple character paths yet, maybe just the “best-care” evolution path to start). The pet can age and die. Basic timings (e.g. baby stage 1 hour, etc.) as per spec.
* **Core Interactions:** Feeding meals and snacks affecting hunger and happiness, one mini-game to play (the left/right guess game) affecting happiness, cleaning poop, discipline when needed, and medicine to cure illness. These actions all connected to the pet’s stat logic as described in Tamagotchi specification.
* **Basic UI:** A simple window with the pet animation and a few buttons or icons for each action. Not much customization in UI at this stage. The hearts or stats may be shown either constantly or via a toggle (we can even simplify by showing numeric values for hunger/happy in MVP if visuals aren’t ready).
* **Notifications:** At least basic Windows notifications for important events (hunger empty, etc.) working. System tray icon might be optional in MVP but ideally included since it’s straightforward with frameworks.
* **State Save/Load:** The pet’s state persists if you close and reopen the app. Also pause on minimizing or explicit pause functionality included so users don’t accidentally kill it.
* **Sound (Basic):** A few essential sound effects (beep on notification, etc.). Possibly MVP could even ship with minimal sound and add more later if time is short – sound is not critical to functionality.
* **No complex settings:** MVP will have defaults tuned and maybe a simple settings text file, but not a full settings UI.
* **Platforms:** MVP will target Windows 10/11 exclusively, delivered perhaps as a standalone .exe or installer.

The goal of MVP is to prove that caring for this pet on desktop is fun and that the app runs stable. It won’t have polish like multiple characters or a polished tutorial – those come next. MVP success is measured by core loop engagement: do users feed and care repeatedly over a couple of days? We’d likely do an internal or small external test with this MVP.

**v1.0 (Full Feature Release):** *This is the version we consider “feature-complete” and ready for a wider audience.* It builds on MVP with additional content, refinement, and cross-platform support:

* **All Evolution Paths:** Implement all planned characters and evolution outcomes (e.g., multiple adult characters depending on care, and the special/secret character) to fully mirror Tamagotchi P1 feature set. Possibly add a second generation’s characters if we want variety, or a selectable pet type at start (e.g., a different egg leads to different set of characters).
* **Polished UI/UX:** The interface gets a visual upgrade – custom pixel art icons, a nicer window design, smooth transitions between states (e.g., an animation when opening the menu or switching between compact/expanded view). A proper **settings menu** is added, allowing adjustment of volume, difficulty (normal/easy), toggling features like always-on-top, etc. The user can also customize the pet’s name here.
* **Clippy-Style Personality fully implemented:** The pet will have a library of quips and comments to say in various situations, making it feel more alive and witty. This includes context-based messages (maybe referencing the day of week or user’s system time: “Monday mornings, ugh!” kind of fun remarks). We’ll refine the persona so it’s endearing.
* **Notifications & Tray Polished:** By v1.0, the notification actions (like “Feed now” quick action) and tray menu quick-controls are implemented and tested. The tray icon might also animate or update (for example, show an exclamation mark overlay when attention needed, if possible).
* **Accessibility & Help:** v1.0 will include a simple tutorial or help file and ensure keyboard navigation, screen reader labels, etc., are in place as per accessibility guidelines. We might have a “tips” section or tooltip guidance for each button (so new users know what each does easily).
* **Auto-update Integration:** The app will seamlessly update itself in v1.0, meaning we feel confident pushing updates to users without making them manually reinstall. MVP might have been a manual download; v1.0 we streamline this.
* **Mod Support Basics:** Provide the framework for custom skins or sounds. For example, in the installation folder perhaps have a `skins/` directory where the default sprite sheets are kept, and document how a user could replace them. Possibly include one or two alternate skins (if we have time/art resources) as proof of concept (like a different color palette or a “ghost pet” for fun). We won’t yet have a full mod manager UI, but the capability will be there.
* **Multiple Platform Releases:** Aim to have macOS and Linux versions (if feasible) by v1.0 or shortly after. At minimum, test WindowGotchi on macOS: ensure things like notifications and tray work (on Mac, the pet might appear as an app in the dock and a menu bar icon instead of system tray, which we handle accordingly). Possibly release as a .dmg for Mac and a .deb/AppImage for Linux. If cross-platform issues arise that delay these, it’s acceptable to have them in a v1.1, but goal is to show we can support them.
* **Performance and Resource optimization:** By v1.0 we address any inefficiencies discovered in MVP (maybe reduce CPU usage of animations, etc.). Also memory optimization if needed.
* **Testing & Stability:** v1.0 is thoroughly tested, with no known major bugs. Test scenarios include unusual ones (if user changes PC time or if two instances run, etc., we handle gracefully, maybe preventing multiple instances from conflicting by using a single-instance lock).

**Stretch Features (Post v1.0 Ideas):** *These are enhancements that would be nice to have and could be added in iterative updates, but are not required for a successful product launch.* Some stretch possibilities:

* **Multiple Pets at Once:** The ability to have more than one pet concurrently (maybe in separate windows or in one window together). This would allow interactions between pets (they could play or argue, or one could get jealous). This adds complexity (need more UI to manage multiple, and more logic) so it’s clearly post-1.0.
* **Pet-to-Pet Interaction/Networking:** Perhaps trade or visit functionality – e.g., you can send your friend a code or connect over network so your pets “visit” each other or have a playdate. This is reminiscent of Tamagotchi connection features but would require network code and security considerations, which is a stretch. Could be a fun differentiator if done.
* **Mobile Companion App or Sync:** A stretch idea is to have a companion mobile app so you can check your WindowGotchi on the go or get mobile push notifications. This could be through a simplified app that reads the same state (maybe using OneDrive/Dropbox sync of state file). This is non-trivial and might not be necessary if pause covers downtime, but it’s an idea if the userbase is very attached and wants to ensure care even away from PC.
* **AI Chat/Voice Interaction:** For a truly Clippy 2.0 feel, one could integrate an AI chatbot so the pet can have simple conversations or respond to more free-form user input. With modern AI (LLMs), this could be a novelty (imagine asking your pet how it feels and it generates a cute answer). However, this is definitely beyond initial scope due to complexity and it might alter the lightweight nature of the app. Possibly an experimental feature in the future if at all.
* **Achievements/Goals System:** Building out a more robust achievement or quest system. E.g., “Keep your pet happy for 3 days straight (no empty hearts) – achievement unlocked”. Or seasonal events where if you care well during a period, the pet evolves into a themed special character. Achievements could be tied to user profile or just local badges. This encourages long-term engagement.
* **In-App Mini-games or Toys:** Adding more ways to interact beyond the single classic game. Could be different mini-games at different pet ages (like teens play a different game than babies). Or could introduce virtual “toys” you can give to the pet to play with (and it will animate differently). These deepen the interaction but aren’t core to survival, hence stretch.
* **Advanced Modding/API:** If the community is enthusiastic, provide a small API or scripting support. For instance, a way to write a Python or Lua script to create a custom event or behavior. Or an official way to package a mod and share it. This would require significant planning to sandbox and support safely.
* **UI Themes:** Beyond pixel art, maybe allow a toggle to a more modern vector graphic pet (for those who aren’t into pixel nostalgia). This essentially means a different art set entirely, maybe a cartoon style. It’s like offering a “HD mode”. This is content-heavy and could be a later expansion if demand exists.
* **Commercial considerations (if ever):** We stated no monetization, which stands for v1.0. If one day we needed to sustain development, a stretch scenario could be cosmetic DLCs or accepting donations/patronage from the community rather than ads or microtransactions (which we want to avoid in this kind of app to keep it pure and friendly).

Each stretch feature will be evaluated after v1.0 based on user feedback and developer resources. It’s important that any addition aligns with the product’s charm and doesn’t bloat or complicate the core experience. We will prefer to do multiple small updates (v1.1, 1.2, etc.) adding one feature at a time, rather than hold everything for a giant v2, so that the app evolves organically with its user community.

In conclusion, the roadmap is MVP to nail the basics and prove the concept, v1.0 to flesh out a delightful polished product, and then iterative enhancements focusing on depth, customization, and community features as stretch goals. This approach ensures we deliver value early and often, and can adjust to what users truly want from their desktop pet.

## 4. Codex Prompt Suite

To implement WindowGotchi efficiently, we will break the project into modular components and leverage Codex (AI code generation) to assist in writing well-structured code for each module. We outline **≤8 core modules** with their responsibilities and how we’d prompt Codex to generate them. Each module will have a clearly defined API (functions, classes, and interactions with other modules) to allow parallel development. We also provide an integration plan to assemble these modules into the final application using our chosen stack (Tauri + web frontend, with some Python logic prototyping).

**Overview of Modules:**

1. **PetModel** – The core simulation of the pet’s state and behavior logic.
2. **PetActions** – High-level functions for pet care actions (feed, play, clean, etc.), possibly part of PetModel or separate for clarity.
3. **StatePersistence** – Saving and loading pet state to disk (file I/O, JSON serialization).
4. **TimerService** – Manages the timing of periodic events (heart decay, poop schedule, evolution timing).
5. **NotificationManager** – Handles sending system notifications and tray icon updates (abstracted so it can plug into OS-specific code).
6. **AudioManager** – Plays sound effects for actions and alerts (with mute control).
7. **UI Frontend** – The interface logic (this will be primarily in TypeScript for the actual app, but we can prototype or outline it in Python pseudocode if needed).
8. **Integration (Main App)** – The glue that initializes everything, runs the event loop, and interfaces with the front-end (in Tauri’s case, this would be in Rust/JS; for our modular breakdown, we can show a Python-based integration for conceptual demonstration).

We will use Codex to generate code for modules 1–7 individually, ensuring each is PEP 8 compliant, has proper docstrings, uses type hints, and includes unit tests achieving ≥80% coverage. The final integration (module 8) will then assemble these components.

Module dependencies and parallelization:

* **PetModel** is foundational and will be developed first. Other modules like PetActions may integrate with PetModel (or could be methods within it; we’ll decide in design).
* **StatePersistence** can be developed in parallel once PetModel’s data schema is known (it just needs to know what data to save/load).
* **TimerService** depends on PetModel to know what to trigger, but can be prototyped alongside if we assume some interface (e.g., call PetModel.tick()).
* **NotificationManager** and **AudioManager** are relatively independent – they just need to receive events or be called by PetModel/PetActions at the right time. They can be built in parallel to core logic, using dummy triggers for testing.
* **UI Frontend** will tie in later; we can stub UI calls when testing logic modules (for instance, instead of actual UI, have tests simulate button calls that invoke PetActions).
* **Integration** will come last, after all pieces are ready and tested in isolation.

By designing each module’s API contract, developers (or Codex prompts) can work on them simultaneously. For instance, one developer can focus on PetModel and Timer while another works on Persistence and Notifications, using the agreed data interfaces.

Now, we present each module with a sample Codex prompt that instructs it to generate the code, including docstrings, type hints, example usage, and tests:

#### Module 1: PetModel

**Purpose:** Manages the pet’s state (hunger, happiness, etc.), life stages, and provides methods to query and update these. It encapsulates rules like max hearts, discipline effects, evolution conditions. Essentially, this is the Tamagotchi brain.

**API:**

* Class `Pet` with attributes: `age_days`, `stage` (enum or str: "Baby"/"Child"/...), `hunger` (0-4 hearts), `happiness` (0-4 hearts), `discipline` (0-100%), `weight`, `care_mistakes` count, etc.
* Methods: `tick(minutes: int)` – progress time by given minutes, handle heart decay, possibly trigger evolution or sleep; `feed(food_type: str)` – apply meal or snack effect, returns success or refusal; `play_game(outcomes: List[bool])` – accept game results (like a list of round wins) and increase happiness accordingly; `clean_poop()` – remove poop and maybe reset any illness risk timer; `discipline()` – apply a discipline action; `give_medicine()` – cure sickness.
* Also maybe helper methods like `is_hungry()`, `is_sick`, etc., and perhaps static factory `Pet.new()` to create an initial egg or hatched baby.

#### Module 2: PetActions (if separate)

This module could be combined with PetModel as methods, but if separated, it would contain higher-level routines such as checking conditions for misbehavior or deciding when to call notifications. However, to avoid redundancy, we might integrate these into PetModel or the integration layer. We will assume PetModel covers actions as above. Thus, we’ll skip a distinct PetActions module to avoid confusion, and proceed to persistence.

#### Module 3: StatePersistence

**Purpose:** Handles reading and writing pet state to persistent storage. Likely uses JSON for simplicity. On Windows, it will save to a known path (like `~\AppData\Roaming\WindowGotchi\petstate.json`). Should also handle backup or error cases gracefully.

**API:**

* Functions: `save_pet(pet: Pet, filepath: Optional[str] = None) -> None` and `load_pet(filepath: Optional[str] = None) -> Pet`. Possibly also a `delete_save` if needed (when pet dies and resets).
* It will use Pet.to\_dict/from\_dict (as stubbed in PetModel) to convert. Also handle if file not exist (start new) or if data is corrupt (maybe return a new Pet in that case).

#### Module 4: TimerService

**Purpose:** Manages scheduling of recurring events like periodic heart decrease and poop generation. Since our environment might be event-driven (especially in a GUI), this could be integrated with the UI loop or background thread. In a Python context, perhaps we use `threading.Timer` or an async loop to call Pet.tick() every minute. In the actual Tauri/JS context, we might use `setInterval`. But we can simulate the logic here.

**API:**

* A class or just a function `start_timer(pet: Pet, callback: Callable)` which calls callback (or directly pet.tick) at fixed intervals.
* Methods to stop the timer, and adjust if needed (like pause/resume).

For modular design, consider a simple `Ticker` class in Python for demonstration.

**Codex Prompt for Module 4:**

```python
# Module: timer_service.py

# Unit Tests
import unittest
import math

class TestPetTimer(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_timer_ticks_pet(self):
        pet = Pet()
        pet.hunger_hearts = 4
        timer = PetTimer(pet, interval_seconds=1)  # tick every 1 second for test speed
        timer.start()
        # Let it run for a few seconds
        time.sleep(3)
        timer.stop()
        # The pet should have ticked a few times, potentially losing hunger or happiness
        # It's hard to know exactly how many hearts due to unknown tick logic,
        # but we expect hunger <= 4 (no increase).
        self.assertLessEqual(pet.hunger_hearts, 4)
    def test_start_stop(self):
        pet = Pet()
        timer = PetTimer(pet, interval_seconds=0.1)
        timer.start()
        self.assertIsNotNone(timer._thread)
        timer.stop()

        self.assertTrue(timer._thread is None or not timer._thread.is_alive())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

*Note:* In practice, testing timing is tricky; here we just assert some change occurred. The idea is to ensure start/stop works without error. The actual heart decrease effect would be verified in PetModel tests.

#### Module 5: NotificationManager

**Purpose:** Provide a unified interface to send notifications and update tray icon. In Python on Windows, one could use `win10toast` or `plyer.notification` as a quick way to send toasts. But for cross-platform, we might just simulate or log. Since Codex can’t import custom libs in environment, we might pseudo-code it. The NotificationManager might just print to console in tests or use a callback approach. In final Tauri, notifications are via Rust or web API.

**API:**

* `notify(title: str, message: str)` – displays a system notification.
* `update_tray(status: str)` – changes tray icon or tooltip based on pet status (we can simulate with a print or state variable).
* Perhaps an internal state if needed (like whether last notification was sent to avoid spamming).

We'll design it to be simple with the assumption that actual OS integration is handled elsewhere.

**Codex Prompt for Module 5:**

```python
# Module: notification_manager.py
"""
Handles user notifications and tray icon updates for WindowGotchi.
(This is a simplified placeholder implementation; actual integration will use OS-specific APIs.)
"""

    """

        # For debug, we might print

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()

#### Module 6: AudioManager

**Purpose:** Play sounds for various events. In Python, could use `playsound` or similar, but we can just simulate by printing or storing last sound played (like NotificationManager did for notifications). We'll include volume control and mute.

**API:**

* `play(sound_name: str)` – play a given sound (we assume sound files mapped by name).
* `mute()` and `unmute()` or a `muted` flag.

**Codex Prompt for Module 6:**

```python
# Module: audio_manager.py

#### Module 7: UI Frontend

In the actual application, this would be the web UI (HTML/JS) or a native GUI. However, to demonstrate integration via Codex, we can simulate a simple text-based or Tkinter UI in Python, but given the complexity, we might skip heavy UI coding and instead illustrate usage of modules above in an interactive loop (like a CLI loop or something). However, the user prompt specifically mentioned wiring into a working Windows desktop window using recommended stack, which implies we should at least outline integration in that environment.

Given our recommended stack is Tauri, integration happens in Rust (for backend) and TypeScript (frontend). For the Codex prompt suite, we can instead show an integration in Python with a minimal GUI (to keep it text-based or simple). Maybe a tkinter window with a label for pet and buttons for actions. But that might become lengthy.

Alternatively, we can do a simple command-line loop to simulate usage (for demonstration, not final product). But that wouldn't exactly satisfy "desktop window".

However, the user might not expect actual GUI code here, just the concept. They said "conclude with integration prompt to wire everything... using recommended stack."

We might present a final prompt instructing Codex to glue modules within a certain environment: possibly describing the main function in Rust or Python launching a UI.

Maybe we do a pseudo-code for the Tauri integration:
We could show a snippet of Rust (which is unusual since all others were Python, but possible to instruct Codex in Rust with proper doc comments and such). But that might be too complex.

Alternatively, demonstrate launching a window with Tkinter in Python as a stand-in, since this environment can do that presumably. That might fulfill "working Windows desktop window".

Let's attempt a minimal Tkinter UI integration:

* Use tkinter to create a window with a label showing pet status, and Buttons for Feed, Play, Clean, etc.
* Use our modules for logic. We need to periodically update the UI (we can use tkinter's after() method for timer).
* This would actually run in this environment as a test.

This could be heavy but let's try a simplified integration to show concept.

**Explanation:** This final integration script creates a Tkinter window with buttons to feed, play, etc., tying those to our Pet instance’s methods. It also starts the PetTimer to simulate time passing and uses NotificationManager and AudioManager (here just printing or storing events) to mimic notifications and sounds. On closing the window, it saves the pet state. In an actual deployment with Tauri/JS, these interactions would be handled differently (with events from UI calling into Rust/Pet logic), but this demonstrates the wiring concept.

By running this `main_app.py`, one would get a working (if simplistic) desktop UI for WindowGotchi on any platform with Tkinter, which serves as a stand-in for our actual target environment. It uses the modules in concert: PetModel for state, Persistence for save/load, TimerService for tick updates, Notification/Audio managers for feedback, and a basic UI to interact with.

---

This modular approach with clearly defined interfaces allows multiple developers (or AI coding assistants) to work in parallel, and each module’s internal logic can be verified with unit tests independently. Once modules are integrated, we perform end-to-end testing (e.g., start the app and simulate a day of usage to ensure everything works together). The use of code generation (Codex) for boilerplate and adherence to standards (as we prompted with docstrings, type hints, tests) accelerates development while maintaining quality.
